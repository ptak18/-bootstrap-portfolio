READ ME file that describes a portfolio created mainly using Bootstrap:

*Bootstrap Portfolio
This portfolio is a basic website that uses Bootstrap to create a responsive and mobile-friendly layout. It includes a main navigation bar, a hero section, a portfolio section, and a contact section. I then added the screenshots to the README.md files on GitHub by copying and pasting then commiting to the main branch.

Once I had the neccessary software installed, I cloned the repository and opened the index.html file in my web browser.

Once I was okay with the portfolio (given the deadline), I deployed it to a web hosting service - Git Pages.
